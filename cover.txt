Identify with whom you've collaborated and in what manner, if any :

Haoyu Yun (discussed a bug about illegal feedback), Jingbin Huang (discussed how to use constraints file instead, helped fix a typo in a constraint file, and discussed refresh counters for lab 2 (but I donâ€™t think we are turning that in since it says we only need to turn in lab 3, the final product, so I attached the raw data files that I used to get working the original morse decoder along with the actual final verilog file (just 1, called morseWorks.v) that I mainly used with the only .xdc file in the zip file.
